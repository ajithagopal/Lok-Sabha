            <p class="first-phara">The front page gives it away. <i>The Hindu’s</i> headline five years ago confidently
              read ‘India Gives Modi a High Five.’ In 2024, the hand wavered, as the title chosen is “BJP falls short,
              need allies to govern.” On the mighty inked finger is a caricature of Prime Minister Narendra Modi perched
              next to Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi — a picture that defines the politics of the 18th Lok Sabha. An
              unsteady dependence overtook BJP’s unassailable dominance in the previous two elections. The BJP
              government’s mandate was weaker; meanwhile, the Opposition INDIA bloc defied expectations and regional
              parties thrived. On June 5, the Indian electorate map was less saffron, more colourful, with shades of
              green, red and blue. It was a pyrrhic victory for the BJP.
            </p>
            <p>The Lower House formed at the tail end of a long-winded election was unlike its nearest predecessors. Its
              agenda was almost a decade in the making. </p>

            <p>Unemployment, agrarian distress and inflation had peaked, personal and political freedoms had declined.
              Extreme weather and artificial intelligence posed new challenges. Against this, the ruling government
              counted as wins its GDP-led growth, welfare measures, Ram Temple’s construction and Article 370’s
              abrogation. It cited India’s rise as a global power and the fastest growing economy, countering China’s
              influence on the global stage. </p>

            <p>But its pitch faltered in the lead-up to the 18th Lok Sabha. The 2024 verdict showed the “limits of
              communal polarisation” while revealing a desire for constructive nation building, <a
                href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/people-at-the-centre-on-the-2024-verdict/article68251276.ece"
                target="_blank"> <i>The Hindu’s</i> editorial noted. </a> “The BJP must heed that message in a
              democratic spirit, and reorient itself to the reality of the reemergence of the coalition politics after
              10 years.”</p>

            <div class="row slow-intro-element">
              <p>India conducted the world’s largest election exercise between April 19 and June 1, spread across
                seven-phases. 64.2 crore voters, accounting for 10% of the world’s population, elected members to Lok
                Sabha’s 543 seats. Over 8,000 candidates were in the fray, with 16% fielded by national parties, 6% by
                State parties, and 47% of candidates being independents, a report by PRS Legislative Research said. This
                is the highest number of candidates since 1996. </p>

                this set of elections in comparison to the 2019 and even the 2014 general elections.”</p>

              <p>An analysis of ECI’s data finds that in the first five phases, turnout fell in northern states (such as
                Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh), and increased in southern and western regions such as
                Karnataka, Telangana and Maharashtra. Until May 24, Nagaland registered the biggest dip in voter
                turnout, from 82.91% in 2019 to 57.72% this year. The Eastern Naga People’s Organisation had urged the
                constituency’s four lakh voters to abstain from voting over its longstanding demand for a separate state
                comprising the six districts. Elsewhere, such as in Kerala, Mumbai and Lucknow, <a
                  href="https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/general-elections-2024-urban-apathy-continues-nearly-58-per-cent-turnout-in-phase-5/article68197310.ece"
                  target="_blank">voter apathy gutted people’s participation too.</a> </p>

              <p>In the final count, Lakshadweep recorded the highest voter turnout at 84% followed by Assam at 81%. The
                lowest turnout was recorded in Bihar at 56.19%. Uttar Pradesh (56.92%) and Mizoram (56.87%) were the
                other low turnout states.</p>
              <p>A marked change emerged in Kashmir which headed to polls after years of boycotting the Indian
                Elections. Encouraging was the turnout in Srinagar and Baramulla; the latter registered its highest
                voter turnout since 1984. Livelihood concerns, internet censorship and “the limitations on political
                activity in the Valley since 2018 have constrained citizens who have had little recourse to airing their
                grievances due to the absence of legislative representation in the Assembly”, </p>

                  target="_blank">Summer elections were, once upon a time, unthinkable in India. </a>But precedent
                changed post 2004. This year, the 44-day election cycle overlapped with an acute heatwave, which the
                National Disaster Management Authority warned could expose people to health hazards. Heat spells cast a
                sticky shadow over both campaigning and polling; the ECI suspected ambient heat dissuaded voters in the
                early phases of the General Election.</p>

            <p>The BJP huffed and puffed its way across the halfway mark, falling almost 32 short of an absolute
              majority (it had secured 303 parliamentary seats in 2019). The Congress, on the other hand, won 99 seats
              in contrast to its 52 seats in 2019. </p>

            <p>The NDA secured 291 seats against the Congress-led INDIA bloc’s 234 seats. </p>

            <p><a

                target="_blank"><i>The Hindu’s </i> editorial remarked, </a> “People are, and should be, at the centre
              of a democracy. The outcome of the 18th general election is an unambiguous reiteration by the people of
              that tenet.”</p>

            <p>Political scientist Ashwani Kumar of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) looked at the results
              as a return to a more centrist political outlook. “Given the rich tradition of centrist politics in India,
              the BJP is set to enter into the Rajdharma of rainbow coalition, reverting to Atal Behari Vajpayee’s
              consensual politics of governance [while] reinventing the idea of cooperative federalism. Thus, let’s
              expect what a legendary political scientist called a ‘consocial’ or power sharing democracy, within the
              majoritarian polity of India,” he said.</p>

            <p>The Lok Sabha elections also saw simultaneous Assembly elections for Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra
              Pradesh and Odisha.</p>

            <p>The BJP faced setbacks in its trusted bastions while making headway elsewhere. It registered gains in
              Odisha, winning 19 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats. The party drew a blank in Tamil Nadu but its vote share
              increased to double digits, without <a

              breakthrough in Kerala, with actor-turned-politician Suresh Gopi winning from the Thrissur constituency.
              Its alliance with Janata Dal (Secular) handed the party 19 seats in Karnataka, with the Congress winning
              nine. In Telangana, both BJP and Congress won eight seats each, wiping out the regional Bharat Rashtra
              Samiti (BRS). </p>

            <p>Mr. Modi relied on his individual charm and magnetism as a populist leader but the Modi wave wasn’t as
              pronounced as the previous elections. Mr. Modi’s aura, albeit alluring, is also “inherently unstable, and

            <p>INDIA witnessed a comeback in UP with its ally Samajwadi Party registering a resurgence. It also made
              headways in other Hindi belt States like Rajasthan, Bihar, Haryana and Jharkhand. While Congress lost
              Chinchwara, a seat it held for 40 years, its strike rate improved this time from 9.3% to 28.3%, data
              showed. </p>

            <p>Acting as a bulwark against BJP were regional parties. The BJP ended with lower tallies in Uttar Pradesh
              and Rajasthan. Victories in some parts echoed people’s anxieties over jobs, reservation and Constitutional
              integrity. Although the consecration of the idol in Ayodhya was expected to be a win for the BJP, two holy
              sites for Ram rejected the BJP: Samajwadi Party’s Dalit candidate Awadesh Prasad won from Faizabad (home
              to Ayodhya) and DMK alliance partner IUML's Navaskani, won from Ramanathapuram (home to Rameshwaram). The
              BJP lost Ayodhya and Muzaffarnagar, the citadels of Hindu assertion.</p>

            <p>Its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, implemented weeks before the West Bengal elections, failed
              to make a dent in the State. In other battleground states like Maharashtra, the split of the two major
              regional parties, the Shiv Sena and National Congress Party, divided votes. The Mahayuti alliance —
              comprising of the BJP, Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP) – contested
              the Maha Vikas Aghadi– with the Indian National Congress, Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) (Shiv
              Sena-UBT), and the Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) (NCP–SP). The latter made gains. </p>

            <p>There were multiple players of the match, including MK Stalin, Akhilesh Yadav, Mamata Banerjee, Rahul
              Gandhi, and the Bharat Adivasi Party’s Rajkumar Roat. </p>

            <p>At the finishing line though, Bihar’s Nitish Kumar and Andhra Pradesh’s Chandrababu Naidu emerged as key
              figures, winning a crucial number of Lok Sabha seats. "Nitish and Naidu play kingmakers,” reported <i>The
                Hindu’s </i> Sobhana K. Nair, as the survival of an NDA government depended entirely on whether these
              two remained in the alliance and lent their seat tally, ensuring that NDA crossed the required majority
              mark. </p>

            <h2>The politics</h2>

            <p>Among the usual mudslinging between opponents, there was a third party that became the target of
              Opposition ire – the Election Commission.</p>

            <p>Opposition parties questioned its credibility and slammed it for “failing to fulfil its constitutional
              duty,” particularly after there was a delay in release of turnout data, in addition to an increase in the
              revised turnout data released a few days after each polling phase. It also did not release absolute
              turnout information. </p>
            <p>The Supreme Court also refused to accept pleas by civil society organisations that the EC release
              information about voters, particularly from Form 17C. Form 17C provides data about voter turnout in every
              polling station, and is meant to be filled up by the Presiding Officer of the polling station on the day
              of polling.</p>

                target="_blank"><i>The Hindu</i> noted in an editorial</a> that the ECI had “disappointed the Indian
              electorate by its inability to be effective, impartial and prompt in its role as the watchdog of
              elections. This is partly a function of the mechanism of the appointment of the ECI’s members, which is
              entirely a partisan decision of the executive.”</p>

            <p>Ahead of the elections, the Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) mechanism was also called into question. A
              petition by the Association of Democratic Reforms in the Supreme Court requested that there is 100%
              cross-verification of vote counts against VVPAT (Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail). The Supreme Court
              rejected this plea, but said that the burnt memory of the microcontroller in 5% of EVMs would be checked
              by a team of engineers after results were declared, at the written request of candidates coming in second
              or third. The existing practice was the cross-verification by VVPAT slips of five random EVMs in each
              Assembly segment/constituency. </p>

            <p>Allegations of voter suppression also made the rounds, with Muslims alleging such suppression in some
              neighbourhoods of Mathura. Ahead of the elections, YSRCP filed a complaint with the ECI saying that TDP
              was using an app to collect voter information and profile voters in Andhra Pradesh. In several centres
              across the country, people discovered their names missing from the voter lists. </p>

            <p>There were also challenges associated with the nomination of candidates. The nomination of the Samajwadi
              Party’s Khajuraho candidate Meera Yadav was rejected for irregularities, which the party <a
                href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/congress-sp-to-support-aifb-candidate-in-khajuraho/article68069090.ece"
                target="_blank">termed</a> as a “well-planned conspiracy.” In Indore, the Congress candidate Akshay
              Kanti Bam joined the BJP weeks before polling. In Varanasi, the home constituency of Prime Minister Modi,
              the nomination of comedian Shyam Rangeela was rejected, with the ECI saying it was “incomplete.” After the
              rejection of his nomination, Mr. Rangeela in a video message on X alleged that citizens were being
              deprived of their right to contest polls. </p>

            <p>The lead-up to the polls saw the arrest of opposition leaders, the most prominent being that of Delhi
              Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and AAP leader Sanjay Singh in connection with the Delhi liquor excise
              policy scam. Mr. Singh was arrested last October and released on bail in April 2024. Mr. Kejriwal was
              arrested in March 2024 and released on temporary bail for 21 days on May 11; he reentered Tihar Jail on
              June 2. The arrest had led to a public outcry. “This is what dictatorship does, it takes the Chief
              Minister of a State that has come to power with a huge mandate and sends him to jail to send a message
              that this can happen to anyone. Without any proof, without any recovery, anyone can be jailed,” Mr.
              Kejriwal said.</p>
            <p>A Supreme Court judgement declaring the electoral bonds scheme unconstitutional, and the subsequent <a
                href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/decoding-electoral-bonds-data/article67969866.ece"
                target="_blank">release of data by the ECI about electoral bonds </a> anonymously purchased by
              contributors and encashed by political parties between April 2019 and February 15, 2024, caused a ripple
              and raised concerns about transparency. Among all political parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party <a
                href="https://www.thehindu.com/data/electoral-bonds-data-bjp-received-rs-6060-crore-highest-among-all-parties/article67951830.ece"
                target="_blank">encashed electoral bonds worth ₹6,060.5 crore</a> — the highest among all parties, at
              47.5% of all bonds encashed. All India Trinamool Congress followed with ₹1,609.50 crore (12.6%), while
              third on the list was the Congress, which received ₹1,421.9 crore (11.1%). </p>

            <p>During the campaign itself, hate speech was a key issue. The Election Commission of India (ECI) asked the
              BJP and the Congress to desist from raising divisive issues in campaigning in the general election. Mr.
              Modi had referred to Muslims as “infiltrators” and “people with more children.</p>

            <p>In what was the first time for a sitting Prime Minister, the EC <a
                href="https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/election-commission-issues-notice-to-bjp-chief-nadda-on-alleged-model-code-violation-against-pm-modi/article68105108.ece"
                target="_blank">issued a notice</a> for violation of the Model Code of Conduct based on complaints
              against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his speech in Banswara, Rajasthan. Taking a circuitous route, the
              notice, however, was served to BJP President J.P. Nadda, and not Mr. Modi. A similar notice was served to
              Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, concerning complaints related both to him and Rahul Gandhi. The EC
              also issued showcause notices to Congress leader Supriya Shrinate, BJP MP from West Bengal Dilip Ghosh,
              Aam Aadmi Party leader Atishi, Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala, and Bharat Rashtra Samithi chief
              K. Chandrashekar Rao</p>

              groups differently and an incitement of xenophobia for social polarisation,” <a

            <p>Disinformation, as always, remained a concern, along with a new layer of threat generated by Artificial
              Intelligence (AI). Deepfakes have proliferated the web, amplifying the already prevalent threat of fake
              news on social media. <a

            <p>As NDA and India traded barbs, there was a surprise entrant in the battlefield: the Constitution emerged
              as a site of contestation, even among BJP supporters. The Congress’s Rahul Gandhi took to symbolically
              waving a copy of the Constitution at his campaign rallies. The fact Indians are worried about the
              Constitution is of far greater political significance than the question of who wins the election, <a

            <p>Concerns over electoral autocracy, free speech and the independence of the judiciary also played a role.
              Laws governing internet content and the creation of a central fact check unit attracted detractors.
              India’s standing on human rights also came under question, with its NCRB accreditation being put on hold.

        <h2>The agenda</h2>

        <p>The 18th Lok Sabha started with a rarely held contest for the position of Speaker, with Om Birla finally
          being chosen. INDIA demanded that the Deputy Speaker position be accorded to it; the position has remained
          empty over the last two terms. Rahul Gandhi has taken over as Leader of Opposition, with Congress finally
          having enough seats in the House to qualify as the largest Opposition party with over 10% strength in the
          House– a prerequisite for selecting a leader of the Opposition.</p>

        <p>Post the election of Speaker, the Lok Sabha adopted a motion decrying the emergency, thus already starting
          off with a chorus of protests from the Opposition.</p>

        <p>The election of the Speaker and an address by the President took place during a special session of the
          Parliament from June 24 to July 3.</p>
        <p>The first key moment during the 18th Lok Sabha was the declaration of the Union Budget- the first one for the
          NDA’s third term, and also Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s record seventh time.</p>
        <p>Early days of Parliament have also been marred by controversy surrounding the NEET-UG entrance exam. The
          tragic death of three students due to flooding at a civil services exam coaching centre in Delhi, landslide in
          Wayanad, floods across the country, and multiple train accidents have also been the focus of demands for
          discussion during the first days of the Budget session. </p>
        <p>Many more issues are set to arise, both within the house and without, that will guide the path of the 18th
          Lok Sabha.</p>
